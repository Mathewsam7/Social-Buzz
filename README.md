7 data sets - each data set contains different columns and values
A data model - this shows the relationships between all of the data sets, as well as any links that you can use to merge tables.
There is a lot of information here and it’s easy to get lost in the data. So, to make sure you are using the right data to answer the business questions you’ll follow these steps:

###  Requirements gathering
###  Data cleaning
###  Data modelling

As we mentioned above, you have  7 datasets and a data model.

Often you won’t need all these datasets to find what you’re looking for.

So, the first step is to use this data model to identify which datasets will be required to answer your business question - which is to to figure out the top 5 categories with the largest popularity.
We have identified Reaction, Content, and Reaction Types as our relevant data sets.

### To clarify why you made this selection:

The brief carefully it states that the client wanted to see “An analysis of their content categories showing the top 5 categories with the largest popularity”.
As explained in the data model, popularity is quantified by the “Score” given to each reaction type.
We therefore need data showing the content ID, category, content type, reaction type, and reaction score.
So, to figure out popularity, we’ll have to add up which content categories have the largest score.

But! Before we begin to work with the data sets, we’ll need to ensure that the data is clean and ready for analysis…
Now we want to figure out the top 5 categories. To complete your data modelling, follow these steps:

#### 1. Create a final data set by merging your three tables together

We recommend using the Reaction table as your base table, then first join the relevant columns from your Content data set, and then the Reaction Types data set.
Hint: You can use a “VLookUp” formula
 
#### 2. Figure out the Top 5 performing categories

Add up the total scores for each category.
Hint: You can use the “Sum If” formula

#### The end result is in one spreadsheet which contains:

A cleaned dataset
The top 5 categories
